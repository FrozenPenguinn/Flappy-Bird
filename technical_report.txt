Project Beginning Time: 2019.07.28

-----Important features:

# I guess people won't mind if I use spherical chickens in vacuum :P

# Firstly, there should be a background image, can be a pano of some place or just simply
  a piece of lined paper, or can be a marked by yards American football field.

# A Bird object should be constructed, with instance variables colour, size(x, y),
  _is_alive(?). This can be just a circle in version beta, but should be given an
  image in version 1.1

# The Geography object (a map with walls), sizes should be reasonably given to the upper
  lower walls, e.g. wall width, as well as upper and lower wall length to 'y' boundaries

# The def is_impact to tell whether the bird is colliding with the walls, if so game end

# def to detect mouse-clicking, responding with the increase in the birds acceleration 
  (flapping its wings if animation is possible), for better visual effect, the nouse/mouth
  of the bird should be drawn, so that players can know the velocity vector of the bird.

# A button for menu, when opened, should have the buttons 'continue game' & 'quit game'

# On the main menu, there should be a button to start game, and the words 'Flappy Bird'
  and the developer, who is myself.

# A BGM should be added to the game
